Gujarat Medical Service\\nCorporation Limited under the auspices of Department of Health & Family Welfare,\\nGovernment of Gujarat finalizes EML and has undertakenthe taskto develop STG for the\\nState. The objective is to improve the availability of quality drugs at each health facility and\\nto achieve maximum public health improvement using available resources. B. J. Medical\\nCollege & Civil Hospital,Ahmedabad hasbeen instrumental in the preparation of the STG.\\nAn attempt has been made in this manual to provide guidelines for the treatment of common\\ndiseases, keeping in mind the rational use of medicines. It is a blend of evidence from\\nstandard text and reference books with consensus ofspecialists. The guidelines are\\ncomprehensive, concise and seek to summarize treatment plan for patients with priority\\ndiseases. It is assumed that the patient has been fully evaluated and all co-morbidities\\nidentified. Under each clinical condition, thetreatment plan has been suggested that can be\\napplied to average patient with common presentation. However, there may be great variations\\nin patient presentation, their family history, treatment preferences and tolerance for different\\nside effect. Therefore, these guidelines can be viewed as an expert consultation and weighed\\nwith respect to other information. Moreover, the recommendations do not replace clinical\\njudgment nor encroach on clinical flexibility, which must be tailored to the particular needs\\nof each clinical situation.\\nA large number of experienced clinicians have contributed in the preparation of these\\nguidelines. The manual begins with a brief introduction to the concept ofRational Use of\\nMedicinesalong with its important components. Thisis followed by chapters on common\\ndiseases and emergency conditions which may be general to all specialties. Remaining\\nchapters describe frequent clinical conditions in each specialty, for example ENT, Psychiatry,\\nObstetrics andG ynecology etc. The formatof the guidelines includes important salient\\nfeatures, diagnostic tests followed by non-pharmacological, pharmacological treatment plan\\nand patient education, if applicable. Medicines are mentioned in generic names and choice is\\nbased on the balanced criteria of efficacy,safety, suitability and cost.\\nThis manual will be useful as ready reference for the health care providers and supply\\nmanagement staff. We hope this manual will help in pursuance of the objectives ofRational\\nUse of Medicinesand make the treatment more specific and effective. We thank all the\\nexperts for sharingtheirvaluable time and expertise in developing the book.\\nDr. Mira Desai\\nDr. Samidh Shah\\nDr. Geetha Iyer'),\n",

In other words,\\nrational use means ‘prescribing right medicines, in adequate dose for the sufficient duration\\nand appropriate to the clinical needs of the patient at lowest cost’. M edicine useis a complex\\ncyclical process and in the clinical context, rational drug use implies correct drug, appropriate\\nindication and selection with respect to efficacy, safety, suitability for the patient and cost.\\nThe concept of Rational Useof Medicinesis age old; however, it has attained more\\nsignificanceand momentum in terms of medical and socioeconomic aspects recently. Three\\ntools have been identified to implementRational Use of Medicineseffectively. These include\\nEssential Medicines List, Standard Treatment Guidelines andDrug Formulary. To be\\nmeaningful, all three tools should work in concert and subjectforperiodic review and update.\\nI. The concept of Essential Medicines\\nEssentialM edicines(EM) are those that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of\\nthe population and therefore should be available at all times in appropriate amounts and in\\nappropriate dosage forms.Following the concept of EM, WHO published the first\\nEssential Medicine List (EML) in 1977, which has been updated successively every 5\\nyear in view of changing world scenario about the medical needs and availability of new\\nand better drugs.The selection of these medicines is based on public health relevance,\\nevidence of efficacy and safety and comparative cost-effectiveness. Thesepriority\\nmedicines should be available at each functioning health care facilitywith assured quality\\nand adequate information at a price the individual and the community can afford.\\nThe selection of essential medicines depends upon level of health care facility, adequate\\ndata on the efficacy, safety, suitability and comparative cost effectiveness of available\\ntreatments. In addition, stability of the product, need for special diagnostic or treatment\\nfacilities and pharmacokinetic properties are also considered. Most essential medicines\\nare formulatedas single compound. However, fixed dose combinations are selected only\\nwhen it has proven pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic advantages over single\\ncompound administered separately. While comparing the costof medicines among the\\nalternative treatments, the cost of total treatment and not the unit cost is considered. Other\\nfactors taken into account include pattern of diseases, treatment facilities, training and\\nexperience of the available personnel, financial resources etc.\\nAdvantages of Essential Medicines\\nThe implementation of the concept of EM has several logistic and prescribing advantages.\\nFor example better management of medicines i.e. easier procurement, storage,'),\n",

The list ofEM closely relates to\\ntreatment guidelines for clinical diseases andisalso used for the procurement and supply\\nof medicines in public sector, schemes for reimburses medicines costs and local medicine\\nproduction.\\nIts implementation is intended to be flexible and adaptable to different situations; which\\nmedicines are regarded as essential remains a national responsibility.\\nII.Standard Treatment Guidelines\\nStandard TreatmentG uidelines (STGs), treatment protocols, and prescribing policies are\\ndefined assystematically developed statements designed to assist prescribers in making\\ndecisions about the appropriate treatment and health care for specific clinical problem.\\nThese guidelines usually reflect the consensus on the optimal treatment options within a\\nhealth facility or system. In fact, they represent one of the approaches to promote\\ntherapeutically effective and economically efficient use of medicines.\\nSTGs list the preferred pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for common\\nhealth problems experienced by people in a specific health system. The pharmacological\\ntreatment should include the name, dosage form, strength, average dose (pediatric and\\nadult), number of doses per day, and duration of treatment. Other information on\\ndiagnosis and advice to the patient may also be included. The most common diseases and\\nserious medical conditions that have high morbidity and mortality rate are selected.\\nTreatment guidelines must have the most up-to-date and evidence based information to\\ndetermine appropriate treatment options by expert authors and reviewers. Effective\\nimplementation, however, is perhaps the greatest challenge in introducing STGs. When\\nimplemented effectively, it offers several advantages to patients, health care providers,\\nsupply management personnel and policy makers as follows:\\nPatients,\\n\\uf0b7 Most cost-effective optimal therapy is provided.\\n\\uf0b7 Better compliance through consistency among prescribers.\\n\\uf0b7 Improvement in availability of drugs.\\n\\uf0b7 Overall better quality of care.\\nHealth care providers,\\n\\uf0b7 Provides standardized guidance to practitioners\\n\\uf0b7 Quality of care standard-based on expert consensus and basis for monitoring\\n\\uf0b7 Utilizes only formulary or essential medicines, so the health care system needs to\\nprovideonly the medicines in theSTGs .\\nSupply managers,\\n\\uf0b7 Identification of medicines to be available for the most commonly treated problems.'),\n",

Establishing, developing and implementation of STGs\\nisa difficult, lengthy and time consuming process. Moreover, it needs to be updated\\nregularly to reflect changes in treatment strategies. If a regular schedule for updating the\\nSTGs is not followed, they lose credibility and become obsolete.

It is a ready reference to key information on the\\nselection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines. Although the concept\\nof formulary is old, a drug formulary is considered an essential element in achieving\\nrational prescribing in addition to controllingthe costs. The task of development of a\\nformulary in a hospital is usually undertaken by Drugs and Therapeutics Committee with\\na multidisciplinary membership of doctors, pharmacists, nurses and administrative staff.'),\n",

This step gives riseto\\nimportant information about the effectsand adverse effectsof medicines,contributing to\\nthe evidence ofknowledge, necessaryto promote the rational useof drugs.\\nV. Adverse Drug E ffects andDrug Interactions\\nAdverse drug reactions\\nAn adverse drug reaction (ADR) may be defined as ‘ A response to a drug which is\\nnoxious, unintended and occurs at doses normally used for prophylaxis, diagnosis or\\ntherapyof disease, or for the modification of physiological function’ . ADRs are therefore\\nunwanted or unintendedeffects of a medicine, including idiosyncratic effects, which\\noccur during its proper use.\\nAn adverse drug event (ADE) is defined as‘Any untoward medical occurrence that may\\npresent during treatment with a medicine but which does not necessarily have acausal\\nrelationship with this treatment’.\\nTwo types of ADRs and their differentiating characteristicshave been identified.The\\ncommon , predictable, dose relatedreactionwith low mortality is type ‘A’ ADR. For\\nexample,anticholinergic effect oftricyclic antidepressants anddigoxintoxicity. ADRs\\nmay also be unrelatedto the known pharmacological action of a drug. These are\\nuncommon, non-dose related bizarre ‘B’ type reactions , for example,anaphylaxis with\\npenicillins, malignant hyperthermia with halothane.\\nThalidomide marked the first recognized public health disaster related to the\\nintroduction of a new drug. It is now recognized that clinical trials, however through,\\ncannot be guaranteed to detect all adverse effects likely to be caused by a drug. Health\\nworkers are thus encouraged to record and reportto their national pharmacovigilance\\ncentre any unexpected adverse effects with any drug to achieve faster recognition of\\nserious related problems.The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization(CDSCO),\\nDirector General of Health Services under the influence of Ministry of Health & Family\\nWelfare, has initiated a nationwide Pharmacovigilance programme for protecting the\\nhealth of the patients by assuring drug safety.\\nThe specific aims and objectives of the National Pharmacovigilance Programme are:\\n\\uf0b7 To monitor ADRs in Indian population.\\n\\uf0b7 To create awareness amongst health care professionals about the importance of  ADR\\nreporting in India\\n\\uf0b7 To ensure that the benefits of use of medicine outweighs the risks andthus safeguard\\nthe health of the Indian population\\n\\uf0b7 To generate independent, evidence based recommendations on the safety of medicines'),\n",

These ADR monitoring centers are located at MCI approved medical\\ncolleges and hospitals, private hospitals, public health programmes, and autonomous\\ninstitutions such as Indian Council of Medical Research etc. The ADRmonitoring centers\\nrecord and analyze the ADEs and submit them to the National Coordinating center via\\nonline reporting system known as Vigiflow.\\nSpontaneous reporting\\nSpontaneous reporting is the reporting of ADRs by healthcare professionals (and in some\\ncountries consumers) to identify and report any suspected adverse drug reaction to a\\npharmacovigilance center and/or to the manufacturer. It is one of the important methods\\nof collecting information about ADRs.\\nAll suspected adverse reactions, known orunknown, serious or otherwise should be\\nreported. It is important to report even minor reactions of new drugs. For established\\ndrugs, the reporting of serious ADRs is important. An increased frequency of a known\\nADR to a drug is also important.\\nAdverse drug reactions may be reported or notified to the nearest ADR monitoring centre\\nunder the National Pharmacovigilance Program. The Department of Pharmacology, B. J.\\nMedical College is one of the approved ADR monitoring center in Gujarat state. The\\nADRs can be reported by the forms available at the department.Reporting is the process\\nof providing ADR information by filling in the ADR form appropriately giving details of\\nthe clinical case as well as the ADR( Appendix– I).\\nMajor factors predisposing to adversedrug effects\\nIt is well known that different patients often respond differently to a given treatment\\nregimen. For example, patients taking combinations of drugs known to interact, only a\\nsmall number show any clinical evidence of interactions. In addition to the\\npharmaceutical properties of drug therefore, there are characteristics of the patient which\\npredispose to ADRs.\\nExtremes of age:The very old and the very young are more susceptible to ADRs. Drugs\\nwhich commonly cause problems in the elderly include hypnotics, diuretics, non-steroidal\\nanti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensives, psychotropics and digoxin.\\nAll children and particularly neonates, differfrom adults in their response to drugs. Some\\ndrugs are likely to cause problems in neonates (for example morphine), but are generally\\ntolerated in children. Other drugs (for example valproic acid) are associated with\\nincreased risk of ADRs in children of all ages. Other drugs associated with problems in\\nchildren include chloramphenicol (G rey baby syndrome), antiarrhythmics (worsening of\\narrhythmias), acetylsalicylic acid (Reye syndrome).\\nIntercurrent illness: If besides the condition being treated, the patient suffers from\\nanother disease, such as kidney, liver or heart disease, special precautions maybe'),\n",

The genetic make-up of the individual patient may also\\npredispose to ADRs.\\nDrug interactions: May occur between drugs which compete for the same receptor or act\\non the same physiological system. They may also occur indirectlywhen a drug-induced\\ndisease or a change in fluid or electrolyte balance alters the response to another drug.\\nIncompatibilities between drugs and intravenous fluids\\nDrugs should not be added to blood, amino acid solutions or fat emulsions. Certain drugs,\\nwh en added to intravenous fluids, may be inactivated by pH changes, by precipitation or\\nchemical reaction. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin lose potency after 6-8 hours if added\\nto dextrose solutions, due to the acidity of the solutions. Some drugs bind to plastic\\ncontainers and tubing, for example diazepam and insulin. Aminoglycosides are\\nincompatible with penicillins and heparin. Hydrocortisone is incompatible with heparin,\\ntetracycline and chloramphenicol.\\nAdverse effects caused by traditional medicines\\nPatients who have been or are taking traditional herbal remedies may develop ADRs. It is\\nnot always easy to identify the responsible plant or plant constituent. Refer to the drug\\nand toxicology information service if available or to suitable literature.\\nThe effect of food on drug absorption\\nFood delays gastric emptying and reduces the rate of absorption of many drugs; the total\\namount of drug absorbed may or may not be reduced. However, some drugs are\\npreferably taken with food, either to increase absorption or to decrease the irritant effect\\non the stomach.\\nVI.Prescription writing\\nA prescription is an instruction from a prescriber to a dispenser. Every country has its\\nown standards for the minimum information required for a prescription, and its own laws\\nand regulations to define which drugs require a prescription and who is entitled to write it.\\nMany countries have separate regulations for prescriptions for controlled drugs such as\\nopioid analgesics.The following guidelines will help to ensure that prescriptions are\\ncorrectly interpreted and leave no doubt the intension of the prescriber. The guidelines are\\nrelevant for primary care prescribing; they may, however, be adapted for use in hospitals\\nor other specialist units.\\nPrescription form\\nThe most important requirement is that the prescription beclear and legibleand indicate\\nprecisely what should be given. The local languagemay be preferred.\\nThe following details should be shown on the form:\\n\\uf0b7 The prescriber’s name, address and telephone number.

The conventional and easy method of evaluating\\ndisturbances in fluid and electrolyte balance is the frequent measurement of the concentration\\nof serum electrolytes. It is crucial to remember that intracellular and extracellular electrolytes\\nare normally constant, and that major shifts in and out of 'compartments' can occur in disease\\nwith minimal changes in serum electrolyte.

Membrane rupture, whether\\nspontaneous or artificial, often sets off the following chain of events:\\n-Amniotic fluid is expelled;\\n-Uterine volume is decreased;\\n-Prostaglandins are produced, stimulating labour;\\n- Uterine contractions begin (if the woman is not in labour) or become stronger (if she is\\nalready in labour).\\nArtificial rupture of membranes\\n\\uf0b7 Note: In areas where HIV and/or hepatitis are highly prevalent, it is prudent to leave the\\nmembranes intact for as long as possible to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV\\n\\uf0b7 Monitor the fetal heart rate.\\n\\uf0b7 Ask the woman to lie on her back with her legs bent, feet together and knees apart.\\n\\uf0b7 Wearing sterile gloves, use one hand to examine the cervix and note the consistency,\\nposition, effacement and dilatation.\\n\\uf0b7 Use the other hand to insert an amniotic hook or a Kocher clamp into the vagina.\\n\\uf0b7 Guide the clamp or hook towards the membranes along the fingers in the vagina.\\n\\uf0b7 Place two fingersagainst the membranes and gently rupture the membranes with the\\ninstrument in the other hand. Allow the amniotic fluid to drain slowly around the fingers.\\n\\uf0b7 Note the colour of the fluid (clear, greenish, bloody). Ifthick meconium is present,\\nsuspect fetaldistress.\\n\\uf0b7 After ARM, listen to the fetal heart rate during and after a contraction. If thefetal heart\\nrate is abnormal(less than 100 or more than 180 beats per minute), suspect fetal distress.\\n\\uf0b7 If membranes have been ruptured for 18 hours, give prophylactic antibiotics to help\\nreduceGroup B streptococcusinfection in the neonate- penicillin G 2 million units IV; ,\\nor  Inj. ampicillin 2 g IV, every six hours until delivery\\n\\uf0b7 Ifgood labour is not established one hour after ARM, begin oxytocin infusion\\n\\uf0b7 Iflabour is induced because of severe maternal disease(e.g. sepsis or eclampsia), begin\\noxytocin infusion at the same time as ARM.\\nAssessment of the cervix\\n\\uf0b7 The success of induction of labour is related to the condition of the cervix at the start of\\ninduction. To assess the condition of the cervix, a cervical exam is performed and a score\\nis assigned based on the criteria(Table5):\\n\\uf0b7 If thecervix is favourable(has a score of 6 or more), labour is usually successfully\\ninduced with oxytocin alone.\\n\\uf0b7 If the cervix is unfavourable(has a score of 5 or less), ripen the cervix using\\nprostaglandins or a Foley catheterbefore induction.'),\n",

Although psychopharmacology forms the backbone of\\ntreatment in most psychiatric disorders, certain points need to be especially emphasized while\\nmanaging psychiatric patients:\\n1) The formation of a trusting,confidential, non-judgemental andempathetic doctor-patient\\nrelationship is crucial to the practice of psychiatry.\\n2) Knowing the person as a whole rather than only his symptoms endorses patient\\nimprovement.\\n3) The psychotic patient often loses his judgementand realityperception.
